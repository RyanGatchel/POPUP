# POPUP

First: I tested this on Chrome and Firefox it worked just fine! When I tried it on Edge it didn't work not sure if it was due to me running it on my own server or what, but this is just a heads up! Okay, with that out of the way.

Hey this is some code to add a popup on your website. This is best used for sites built on bootstrap or sites built with pure html,css, and javascript. If you found this without following the link off of YouTube you can see the video tut here ( https://youtu.be/7MBuRimnjo0 ) :) 

If you don't want to see the video and feel like trying it without here you go: 

First: Go to https://www.staticforms.xyz/ and get your access code. You can do this by following the instructions. 

Second: You have to put the code that is labeled <!--First Part--> and <!--First Part End--> between your <head> element. 
  
Third: You have to put the code that is labeled <!--Second Part--> and <!--Second Part End--> between your <body> element.
  
Fourth: You have to put the code that is labeled <!--Third part--> and <!--Third Part End--> just before your <body> element ends.
  
Fifth: Copy the Coupon.js and Main.css create a file and put the code in the seperate files. 

Don't forget to put in your access code and email in these spots : 
<!--put your access code here--><input type="hidden" name="accessKey" value="your access code here">
<!--put your email here--><input type="hidden" name="redirectTo" value="Your email goes here"> 

If you don't have a web designer but need one I would love to work with you: https://squareup.com/appointments/book/ckbvqiubm4tjpb/Q7R93F9966FWK/date
